## Closing Remarks
Last version isn't it? Yes it is and this is the second robot made from the Pink Fluffy Unicorns [83] in MiniFRC! The repository is now complete and will no longer be receiving updates. Now many things were done this season, we started to use the NoU3 from the NoU2, we switched to mecanum, and the advent of [Imitate!](https://github.com/Turtlerock0010/Imitate) During production of The Punkrocker we had less programming issues then before (which was caused by a faulty ESP32 I absolutely called it). We did help a few teams with code as in getting code to upload and sharing the entirety of what I developed during presseason. Looking back at ADD III all of the goals were achieved so for new goals is to become a major contributor to miniFRC by pushing more rookie teams to use Imitate and helping out more. I am excited to see how far we get in MiniFRC 11.5 so HYPE! Now finally, lets bring this repository home: Thanks To Them of The Pink Fluffy Unicorns, the audience, and event contributors for allowing my hobby and so many other's hobbies of creating robots to come to fruition. I hope I can learn on and expand on my existing work alongside promoting Imitate For The Future and beyond. And finally, keep Watching And Dreaming folks, and yet again, I'll see you next time. Peace!
